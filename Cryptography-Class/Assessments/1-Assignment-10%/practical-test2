# 🔐 Ransomware Cryptography Challenge

## 📌 Scenario

>You are a **malware reverse engineer** and **cryptography analyst**. A suspicious binary simulating ransomware has been found. Your mission: **analyze, break the encryption, and recover the victim's files**.


# 📁 Ransomware Binary Download

You are provided with a **simulated ransomware binary** inside a compressed archive for analysis.

- **File:** `simulated_ransomware.7z`  
- **Contained Binary:** `simulated_ransomware.exe`  
- **Password:** `semogaberjaya`  
- **SHA-256 Hash:**  
  `29cde12c20b7e712a4a412487157f9e46de46455da3d136ad84e41c479ac7c31`

> 📦 Use the hash to verify file integrity before analysis.

## task 1: Static Analysis and Reverse Engineering

## task 2 Identify the programming language or packaging tool used.
