# 🔐 Task 1: Symmetric Encryption and Decryption using AES-256-CBC

## 🧠 Scenario
Labu wants to send a confidential message to Labi. We will use **AES-256-CBC** symmetric encryption with `OpenSSL` to encrypt and decrypt the message securely.

> ⚠️ **Security Note**  
> AES-256-CBC is vulnerable to certain attacks like padding oracle attacks.  
> Use **AES-256-GCM** in real-world applications for authenticated encryption.
