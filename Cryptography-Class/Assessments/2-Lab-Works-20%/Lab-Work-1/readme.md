## 1.2 🧰 Enum4linux Enumeration

Since common ports such as **FTP (21)**, **TELNET (23)**, **SSH (22)**, and **HTTP (80)** are open on the target, we used `enum4linux` to perform enumeration and attempt to extract valid usernames and other valuable SMB-related information.

### 🔧 Command Used:
```bash
enum4linux -a <target-ip>
```

# 🔐 Task 2: Brute Force Attacks

## ✅ Preparation

Before initiating brute-force attacks, prepare the required wordlists:

- `userlist.txt` – A list of potential usernames
- `passlist.txt` – A list of potential passwords

### 🗂️ Wordlist Options

You can choose to:

- Use built-in wordlists provided by Kali Linux (e.g., `/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt`)
- Or create simple custom wordlists for testing:

```bash
# Create a username list
echo -e "admin\nmsfadmin\nanonymous\nuser\ntest" > userlist.txt

# Create a password list
echo -e "1234\nmsfadmin\nftp123\nadmin\npassword" > passlist.txt
```

## 🔹 2.1 FTP Brute Force with Hydra

We used **Hydra** to perform a brute-force attack on the FTP service running on the target.

### 🔧 Command Used:
```bash
hydra -L userlist.txt -P passlist.txt ftp://<TARGET_IP> -V
```

## 3. Sniffing and Traffic Analysis

**🎯 Goal:** Analyze how user credentials are transmitted over various network protocols using Wireshark, highlighting the difference between plaintext and encrypted traffic.

**🛠 Tool Used:** Wireshark  
**🎯 Target IP:** `192.168.188.117`

---

In this task, we capture and inspect traffic from login attempts using different protocols (FTP, Telnet, SSH) to identify whether the transmitted credentials are visible or encrypted.

## 🔹 Steps
1. Open Wireshark.
> **Command:** 
```bash
wireshark
```
  - Choose `eth0` for sniffing traffic.

![Screenshot 2025-04-18 085454](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf6c38b7-90e3-4937-8bbf-7e8946b9131f)
---
2. Start capture on the network interface connected to the target for the FTP.
   - (1) FTP command:
```bash
ftp <target-ip> 
```
   - Enter the `Username = msfadmin` and `Password = msfadmin` as we got exploit from brute force attack before.

---

4. Apply filter on Wireshark:
```bash
ftp || tcp.port == 21
```

3. Get the FTP packet for FTP.
   - Choose the first one packet that have `FTP` and right click.
   - Go to `Follow` and click `TCP Stream`.

---
### 3.2 Capturing TELNET Credentials

1. On the attacker's terminal, connect to the TELNET service adn enter a command:

```bash
telnet 172.20.10.3
```
- Username: `msfadmin`

- Password: `msfadmin`

![Screenshot 2025-04-18 205543](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66c24383-9ca1-4cbe-a0fc-4e450b3f59ca)

![Screenshot 2025-04-18 205621](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5534a8d8-0d58-43a9-88c2-31e14668de0b)
---
2. While typing the credentials, each keystroke is transmitted and captured in plaintext.

3. In Wireshark, apply the filter:
```bash
telnet || tcp.port == 23
```

- Look through the packet list for TELNET traffic.

- Right-click → Follow → TCP Stream

![Screenshot 2025-04-18 210038](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5d73d43-83ea-435e-a469-3082a433364e)


### 3.3 SSH Traffic

1.  **Start an SSH session** from your terminal:

    `ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa msfadmin@172.20.10.3`

    -   **Username**: `msfadmin`

    -   **Password**: `msfadmin`

    > 🛑 If you see this error:\
    > `Unable to negotiate with 192.168.43.137 port 22: no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa,ssh-dss`\
    > Use the command above to force use of `ssh-rsa` which is supported by Metasploitable2.

![Screenshot 2025-04-18 210310](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/459edc2e-6a2c-4ec9-a88c-5a75e4d9f727)


2.  **Open Wireshark** on your attacker machine.

3.  **Apply the filter** to display only SSH traffic:

```
ssh || tcp.port == 22
```


4.  **In Wireshark**:

    -   Observe the captured SSH packets.

    -   Note that the contents are **fully encrypted**.

    -   No credentials or commands can be read in the packet data.

5.  **Optional**: Right-click on any SSH packet → `Follow` → `TCP Stream`.

    -   The stream will display **garbled** or **binary** data, confirming encryption.

## C. Analyze Problems Encounter

#### Issues Faced During Brute Force Attacks

- **Enumeration**: On Metasploitable 2, there were too many usernames, so it was important to carefully check valid usernames.
- **BurpSuite Bruteforce**: Had to be very careful with payload positions in Burp Intruder. A mistake in setting the payload position led to incorrect attack attempts.
- **Metasploitable2 uses an older SSH server version** that may not be compatible with newer OpenSSH clients.  
  To connect successfully, you may need to use the following command:
  
  ```bash
  ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa -oPubkeyAcceptedKeyTypes=+ssh-rsa username@ip
  ```
  This forces the SSH client to accept the older `ssh-rsa` algorithm, which is deprecated in recent OpenSSH versions.

## Mitigation Strategies

| **Problem**                                    | **How to Fix It (Mitigation)**                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force Attacks**                        | Stop users from trying too many wrong passwords. Lock the account or add a delay after several failed tries. Use CAPTCHA. |
| **Plaintext Protocols (FTP, TELNET)**          | Don’t use FTP or TELNET because they send data without protection. Use **SFTP** or **SSH** instead, which are encrypted and safe. |
| **Weak Login Pages (like DVWA HTTP)**          | Use **HTTPS** so data is protected while moving on the internet. |
| **Username is Easy to Find (Enumeration)**     | Don’t show error messages that say if a username is correct or not. Use a general message like “Invalid login” for all failed logins.
